Loose-fitting clothes, comfortable sandals or sneakers, sunglasses, and a hat are must-haves. Sun protection, including sunscreen, is key for long days outdoors.
        
        For Cooler & Winter Months (October–February): Pack layers! Mornings and evenings can be chilly, especially in northern regions. A light jacket or sweater will keep you warm, while breathable clothing works for daytime. Comfortable walking shoes and a scarf for temple visits are always handy.
        
        No matter the season, bring a shawl for religious sites and adventure-ready outfits for outdoor activities!`
